    <h1 class="section-title"> Who We Are </h1>
    <p>
      At <span class="purple-highlight">Gear Lore</span>, we believe every jacket, backpack, or beanie carries a little bit of magic in its stitches.  
      Maybe it’s the <em>fleece that smells faintly of campfire nights</em>, or the <em>beanie that’s seen more sunsets than you can count</em>.  
      We’re here to help those stories continue—one adventure at a time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gear Lore was born out of a simple observation: too many beautiful, sturdy outdoor pieces were being left behind.  
      Closet treasures with tags still dangling, “someday” jackets tucked away, and gear slowly drifting toward donation bins—or worse, landfills.  
      We couldn’t let those adventures go unwritten.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s why our mission is to be the <span class="purple-highlight">bridge</span> between outdoor lovers.  
      We connect people who no longer need their gear with adventurers who are ready to give it new life.  
      From our own carefully curated finds to the treasures shared by our community, every item has a chance to shine again.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the heart of it all, we’re building more than a shop—we’re nurturing a little corner of the internet where stories, sustainability, and style all meet.  
      Because your gear deserves more than storage. It deserves to keep exploring.
